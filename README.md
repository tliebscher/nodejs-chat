# nodejs-chat
Simple chat server with node.js based on http://nodecode.de/chat-nodejs-websocket

I used this project to get to know node.js, npm, bower and gulp

Run:
npm install
bower install
gulp install

A directory build will be created with the packaged server.
CWD to build and run:
node server.js
